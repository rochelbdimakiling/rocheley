            <h2>Excercise Reflection</h2>
            <p>I learned that headings are like titles that help organize a webpage's content. There are different levels of headings (h1-h6) that show what's most important. Paragraphs are blocks of text that group related information together. Using headings and paragraphs makes a webpage easy to read and understand.

When I use headings and paragraphs correctly, it helps people read my webpage and find what they're looking for. It also helps search engines like Google understand what's on my webpage. I'm trying my best to use headings and paragraphs in a way that makes my webpage clear and easy to use.</p>
