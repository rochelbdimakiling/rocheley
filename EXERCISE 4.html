    Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
    Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
    When our friends talk about you
    All it does is just tear me down
    'Cause my heart breaks a little
    When I hear your name
    It all just sounds like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
    That I should've bought you flowers
    And held your hand
    Should've gave you all my hours
    When I had the chance
    Take you to every party
    'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
    Now my baby's dancing
    But she's dancing with another man
    My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
    Caused a good strong woman like you
    To walk out my life
    Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
    And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
    It all just sounds like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
    That I should've bought you flowers
    And held your hand
    Should've gave you all my hours
    When I had the chance
    Take you to every party
    'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
    Now my baby's dancing
    But she's dancing with another man
    Although it hurts
    I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
    Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
    To try and apologize for my mistakes
    But I just want you to know
    I hope he buys you flowers
    I hope he holds your hand
    Give you all his hours
    When he has the chance
    Take to every party
    'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
    Do all the things I should have done
    When I was your man
    Do all the things I should have done
    When I was your man
